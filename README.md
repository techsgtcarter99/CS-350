# CS-350
Welcome to my repository for my CS-350 class on Embedded Systems and Technologies!

The final project in this class was to build code that worked with the CC3220S board from TI SimpleLink, a microcontroller board, in which while the code was running the board would read back out over the IDE the temperature it was set to and how long ago the temperature was changed.  Essentially, the board was going to act as a thermostat and by building a project like this one would be able to build their own smart thermostat with a little more time and with a few additionaly pieces to the board such as a sensor for the current atmospheric temperature.

It took some time figuring out how everything was suppost to work, but by doing some research through the book I was able to figure out how to add the specific code needed to make the board work well with the IDE and it would conduct the input changes made by the user.  I could improve better on my C++ ability, while I enjoy learning the code it still kind of haunts me on writing it but that is all a part of the adventure in learning different coding languages.

I am going to be adding some different books out there like the O'Reilly books to my list of support tools as well as using documentation with the product or tool that I am trying to utilize.

Doing research was very important for this project and I am going to utilize that as well as trying to manage my time better.

I tried to make sure that I put each different function off on it's own and I tried to make the code readable as though if I wasn't the one who worked on it and needed to either add a new function or change some outdated code.
